Group Project Python Intructions 
############################################################
Task:  To complete this group project, you are to write a Python program that completes some outlined task. This task will be determined early in the semester when you submit your idea to me for approval. You will then work on this group project throughout the semester with your team members. You will:

You must submit a project idea. See:  Group Assignment - Project Idea
Output all steps to succeed your goal in a detailed manner in a Word document and submit separately as a Word document
Break up each step into manageable tasks:
Assign tasks to team members
Create a Gantt chart detailing the tasks, the team members assigned, and a proposed due date (I would suggest using Tableau (Links to an external site.) to create a Gantt chart)
Submit this Gantt chart with your final project as an Excel document (you should be able to export your Gantt chart and import into Excel)
Ensure that all tasks function appropriately and then combine them into working chunks of code
Bring together all working chunks of code to create your final program
Document your final program consistently
The code should utilize at minimum (unless you tell me why you won't have this present in your code):
User-defined functions
At least one group-created module
Document strings for all files and for all functions, classes, methods, etc.
Consistent naming scheme (variables, functions, classes, modules, etc)
At least one source of external data, i.e.:
API
CSV
database
User input
Clear instructions where necessary (either user input or in the documentation)
